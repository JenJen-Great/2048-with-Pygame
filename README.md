# 2048 (Pygame)

A simple, polished implementation of the classic 2048 game built with Pygame.

This repository contains a lightweight, animated version of 2048 with smooth tile spawn/slide/merge animations, dynamic tile font sizing, score tracking, win detection, and restart support.

# Demo
Note: This repository does not include demo GIFs yet. If you want to add a demo GIF or screenshot later, create an assets/ or docs/ folder and put the file there (for example assets/demo.gif), then update this section with the relative path.

# Features
- Full 4×4 2048 gameplay mechanics
- Smooth animations for sliding, spawning, and merging tiles
- Dynamic tile font sizing so large numbers fit the tiles
- Win detection (tile ≥ 2048) and Game Over detection

# Controls
- Arrow keys — Move tiles (Up, Down, Left, Right)

# Customization ideas

- Save and display a persistent high score file
- Add sound effects for moves/merges
- Add keyboard controls customization or on-screen buttons
